# Alice Themes
This repository contains a growing collection of theme files  
for use in different applications with the *Alice* color scheme  
If you have an application in mind that you would like to have  
the alice theme for, open an issue and I'll see what I can do.  
Otherwise see the [contributing](#license-and-contributing) section and open a pull request  
with your port.

## Background
If you want general information about the color scheme itself,  
see my [alice-cli](https://github.com/wreedb/alice-cli) repository,  
which contains a program for generating colors for *Alice* in  
multiple different useful formats from a command-line interface.
